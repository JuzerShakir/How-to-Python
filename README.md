If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:**

| **Score** |  **Grade** |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **>=0.9** |  A         |
| **>=0.8** |  B         |

---

### 009. Loop
**Q. Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user inputs *"done"*. Once *"done"* is entered, print out the *total, count, and average* of the *input numbers*. If the user enters anything other than a number,  detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.**
<br>

*Code.*

![Code for Loop](https://i.imgur.com/CttKiRB.png)

<br>

**Output.**

![Output for Loop]()

<br>

*Code.*

![Code for Loop 2](https://i.imgur.com/EckOUBw.png)

<br>

**Output.**

![Output for Loop 2]()

---

### 011. String
**Q. Use *'find'* and *string slicing* to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.**<br>
*str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475'*
    
<br>

*Code.*

### 012. File
**Q. Write a program to read through a file *[mbox-short.txt](https://github.com/JuzerShakir/How-to-Python/blob/master/012.%20File/mbox-short.txt)* and print the contents of the file (line by line) all in upper case.**

**Q. Write a program to read through the file *[mbox-short.txt](https://github.com/JuzerShakir/How-to-Python/blob/master/013.%20File%202/mbox-short.txt)* and look for lines of the form:**<br>

*X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475* <br>

**When you encounter a line that starts with *"X-DSPAM-Confidence:"* pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number from that line. Count number of occurances on the file and then compute the total of the spam confidence values from these lines. Also print out the average spam confidence values.**

**For each line, split the line into a list of words using the *'split'* function. For each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in the list, add it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.**

You can pull the hour from the *'From'* line by finding the time string and then splitting that string into parts using the colon character.**<br>
**Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, one per line, sorted by hour.**
