# Exercise 15

""" Write a program to read through a mail log, build a histogram using a dictionary to count how many messages have come from each email address. 
    Look through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find who has the most messages and print how many messages the person has."""

# opens file

# empty dictionary for counting
counts = dict()

# looping through each line in file
for line in file:
    # interested in lines that start with From
    if line.startswith('From'):
        words = line.split()
        # two 'From's for single message, ignoring duplicate counts
        if len(words) > 2:
            counts[words[1]] = counts.get(words[1], 0) + 1
